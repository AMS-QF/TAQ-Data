### Feature Generation on raw trade and quote data

This directory contains scripts to generate features from raw trade and quote data. Available features can be accessed by running the following command:

```python scripts/feature_gen/list_features.py```

Features are generated by running the following command:

If no  trade_features  or  quote_features  are specified, all available features will be generated.

If no input directory is specified, features will be generated for all files in the raw data directory.

```python scripts/generate_features.py --trade_features <feature_list> --quote_features <feature_list> --input_file <input_file>```

Example:

```python scripts/generate_features.py  --input_file data/raw_data/AAPL_quotes.csv ```



### To add a new feature

1. Create a new file in the  feature_gen/generators script. The function should take a pandas dataframe as input and returns a pandas dataframe as output. The function should be named  generate_<feature_name>  The function should also have a  feature_name  attribute that is the name of the feature.

2. Add the feature to the  feature_list  in  list_features.py.
