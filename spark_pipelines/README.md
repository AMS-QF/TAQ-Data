 ### Spark Pipeline for TAQ Features

This directory contains the pipeline for generating the TAQ features. The pipeline is composed of the following steps:
- Cleaning the data, which is within the 'clean_data.py' file.
- Data preparation, which is within the 'preprocessing_data.py' file.
- Generating the features, which is within the 'feature_generation.py' file.

A tutorial on how to use the pipeline is provided in the 'ExamplePipelines.ipynb' file.
